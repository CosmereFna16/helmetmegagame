# Tag catalog

How the `Tag`/`TagGroup` catalog is structured, master-sourced, and synced.
Not to be confused with `CharacterTag` (an individual character's *holding*
of a tag) or `Location.tags` (free-text flavor strings on a Location,
unrelated to this system).

## 1. Category -> Group -> Tag

Three levels:

- **Category** — a flat string (`Meta`, `General`, `Skills`, `Status`,
  `Items`, `Assets`). Not its own DB table; `docs/tags.yaml`'s top-level
  `categories:` list is validation-only — `syncTagsFromYaml` rejects any
  tag/group whose `category` isn't in that list. **Items are the portable
  half and Assets the standing half**: a revolver or a meal you carry and
  hand over, versus a Manor, a House, or a Follower you simply have. There is
  deliberately no third `Companions` category — the property-vs-companion
  split inside Assets is carried by the `assets-property` /
  `assets-companions` groups, which keeps `TRANSFERABLE_CATEGORIES` (Transfer
  Tag's filter, `web/lib/tagRequests.js`) a two-item list.
- **Group** (`TagGroup`) — optional, scoped to exactly one category, exists
  purely to color tags for display (e.g. Status's Health/Food/Buffs/Debuffs
  groups). A tag with no group renders uncolored. `TagGroup.color` is a
  freeform hex string (e.g. `"#6fa8ab"`), rendered directly by `TagChip.js`
  — not theme-aware, so pick a value that reads on both the dusk and dawn
  backgrounds.
- **Tag** — the catalog entry itself.

## 2. Master sources: `docs/tags.yaml` and `docs/taggroups.yaml`

`docs/tags.yaml` holds categories and tags; `docs/taggroups.yaml` holds the
`TagGroup` catalog (split into its own file so group colors can be freeform
hex rather than a fixed token set). Same posture as `docs/locations.yaml`:
hand-edited, `slug` is the stable match key across syncs, and syncing is
**upsert-only** — removing an entry from either YAML never deletes its row,
it just stops receiving updates. `db/lib/syncTags.js#syncTagsFromYaml(prisma)`
reads both files and does the sync, run by hand via `npm run db:sync-tags`
(`db/prisma/sync-tags.js`) or automatically at the end of `wipeGameData`'s
"Restart Game" flow (`web/app/(app)/gm/dev/actions.js`), right after
`syncLocationsFromYaml`.

The sync is five passes, since tags/groups can reference each other by slug
before every row necessarily exists yet: TagGroup scalars, then Tag scalars
+ `groupId`, then `parentTag`/`requiredTag` links, then `TagGroup.requiredTag`
links, then `requirement.skills`. (`consumesInto` is the exception — it is
validated up front against the YAML's own slug set, before any write, so a
typo fails cleanly instead of half-applying.) Each pass only writes a row when something actually changed (a
diff check, same style as `syncLocationsFromYaml`'s `needsUpdate`).

## 3. Two relations that look similar but aren't

- **`parentTag` (tier chain)** — sequential, replacing. Fighting (Basic) ->
  Fighting (Trained) -> Fighting (Skilled) -> ... Acquiring a tier is meant
  to replace the previous one on the character, not stack alongside it. Also
  used where a specialization *is* the base thing rather than a second copy of
  it: `Follower (Cook)`/`(Laborer)`/`(Goon)` all chain off `Follower`, so
  picking one gives you a follower who cooks — not a follower plus a cook.
- **`requiredTag` (prerequisite)** — non-replacing. The character must
  already hold `requiredTag`, but acquiring this tag does **not** remove or
  replace it. Example in the catalog: `Fighting (Archer)` requires
  `Fighting (Basic)` but coexists with `Fighting (Skilled)` — a character can
  hold both at once. Also the right relation for an origin/membership gate the
  gated tag doesn't consume: `Windlander (Horse)` requires `Windlander`,
  `Manor` requires `Courtier`, `House`/`Shack` require `Ravenhearter`, and the
  `Laborer (…)` specializations require `Laborer` — those stack, several
  specializations on one Laborer, each charged once.
- **`TagGroup.requiredTag`** — the group-level version of the same
  prerequisite: every tag in that group stays gated behind one required tag,
  so a whole category-of-flavor (e.g. a hypothetical "Cultist" group) can be
  hidden behind a single membership tag without repeating `requiredTag` on
  every tag in it.

**Both per-tag relations are enforced by the point-buy menu** (§4), and only
there. `web/lib/characterCreation.js` is where the logic lives:
`requirementSatisfied` hides a tag whose `requiredTag` isn't held or selected,
while `chainOf`/`cumulativeCost`/`effectiveCost` price a `parentTag` chain as
the sum of its hops and `chainSiblingsToRemove` collapses a selection down to
one member per chain. `PointBuy.js` calls them and
`web/app/(app)/character/createActions.js` re-validates both server-side.
Nothing enforces either relation on a GM grant or the (unrouted) mid-game tag
store, and **`TagGroup.requiredTag` is still unenforced everywhere** — that
one is catalog structure waiting on its logic.

## 4. The point economy

`pointCost` is the price in the point-buy menu, and it is **signed**:
positive costs the player points, negative *grants* them (the drawbacks,
Old at `-2` and Frail at `-3`). Both directions fall out of one subtraction,
so `remaining >= 0` is the only rule for whether a build is legal.

**The display inverts it, and both axes agree.** `formatCost`/`costColor`
(`web/lib/characterCreation.js`) show the effect on the player's *point
pool*, never whether the tag is a good thing to have:

| tag | `pointCost` | shown as | colour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frail | `-3` | `+3 pts` | `--positive` (pool grows) |
| Fighting (Basic) | `3` | `-3 pts` | `--accent` (pool shrinks) |
| Shack | `0` | `0 pts` | `--muted` |

These two functions are the only place that flip lives — every caller
(`TagChip`, `PointBuy`, `TagRequestButtons`, `CreateCharacterWizard`) passes
the raw signed `pointCost` and lets them decide, so nothing else should ever
negate it. The arithmetic is untouched: `PointBuy`'s affordability check and
`remaining = budget - sum(pointCost)` both still read the raw catalog value.

Before this, the sign was catalog-style while the colour was pool-style, so
Frail read as "`-3`, in green" — two conventions disagreeing on one line.

A character's budget is
`GameConfig.startingTagPoints` (default 12) `+ role.extra_starting_points`
`- 3 if the player is Cursed`, computed by
`web/lib/characterCreation.js#computeBudget`. Anything unspent is kept on
`Character.tagPoints`.

`purchasable` gates whether a tag can ever be bought — role-granted identity
tags (Courtier, Chaplain, Nobility) are `false`, so they arrive with the role
and never through the menu.

`purchasableAfterStart` splits the two menus that share
`web/app/components/PointBuy.js`: character creation offers every
`purchasable` tag, while the mid-game store offers only those still marked
`purchasableAfterStart`. That's what lets a pick like "Secretly an Android"
exist at launch and never afterward. **Every negative-cost tag must be
`purchasableAfterStart: false`** — a drawback buyable mid-game is a point
farm.

## 5. Other fields

- `visibleOnInspect` — shown to another player who 🔍-reacts to this
  character's proxied messages (`bot/src/events/messageReactionAdd.js`).
  Defaults closed.
- `tradeable` — Items-category flag for a future trade flow; no transfer
  logic exists yet (Transfer Tag filters on `category`, not this).
- `stackable` — whether a character can hold more than one at a time. Live
  code reads this; see §5a.
- `defaultDurationTurns` (spelled `durationTurns` in the YAML) — catalog-level "how many turns does this last once
  granted," for tags that auto-expire (e.g. Drained is 3). The actual
  per-instance expiry lives on `CharacterTag.expiresTurn` (an absolute turn
  number, computed from this default at grant time), swept by
  `resolveNeeds()` in `db/index.js` once the closing turn's number reaches
  it. Live code reads this — Mood (2) and Hunger (1) both compute their
  `expiresTurn` as `turn.number + defaultDurationTurns` — so it is no longer
  catalog-only. Note the ordering it implies: `resolveNeeds()` sweeps *before*
  the Hunger pass grants, so a still-broke character's Hunger is cleared and
  re-granted rather than colliding with `@@unique([characterId, tagId])`. See
  `REQUESTS.md` §4.
- `removable` — whether a player can strip this tag off themselves mid-game
  without a GM. Live: it is the whole filter behind the Remove Tag menu
  (`removableTags()`, `web/lib/tagRequests.js`) and is re-checked by
  `removeTagRequest`.
- `craftable` — whether this tag represents something a player can
  craft/make, as opposed to one that only ever arrives via role, GM grant,
  or automatic game logic. Live too: `addableTags()` offers Purchasable *or*
  Craftable tags in the Add Tag menu.
- `consumable` / `consumesInto` — whether a player can use this tag up, and
  what it becomes. Live; see §5b.
- `requirementTurns` / `requirementResources` / `requirementGambit` /
  `requirementSkills` (YAML: nested under `requirement:` as `turnsCost` /
  `resourceCost` / `gambit` / `skills`) — what it costs a character to add
  or remove this tag in play (e.g. curing Arthritis needs Medical (Skilled)
  and some turns; forging the revolver tag costs turns, resources, and
  Smithing). `requirementSkills` is a many-to-many self-relation onto `Tag`
  (multiple skill tags accepted), resolved in `syncTags.js`'s pass 5. This
  is a GM adjudication reference, also shown to players — not
  automated/enforced by any code, same posture as `requiredTag`/`tradeable`.
  One shared block covers whichever direction (add or remove) is
  narratively relevant to a given tag, rather than separate blocks per
  direction. Rendered everywhere a tag's description already renders, in a
  minified form, via `formatTagRequirement()` (`db/lib/formatTagRequirement.js`,
  exported from `@lifeweb/db`) — see `TagChip.js`, `PointBuy.js`, and the
  🔍-inspect embed in `bot/src/events/messageReactionAdd.js`.

## 5a. Stacks

Meals, ammunition, anything a crafting Move makes in a batch — a character
needs to hold four Fine Meals and hand them out one at a time. `stackable:
true` in `docs/tags.yaml` sets `Tag.stackable`; the count lives on
`CharacterTag.quantity` (default `1`).

**A stack is one row carrying a count, never N rows.**
`@@unique([characterId, tagId])` stays exactly as it was, which is the whole
point: every presence check in the codebase — `narrowcastAccess.js`,
`gambitModifier.js`, `mood.js`, `labor.js`, the Mortus nav gate — keeps
reading "holds it or doesn't" with no change, and `restoreCharacterTag`'s
upsert stays valid.

Three functions in `web/lib/requestEffects.js` are the only writers that know
about `quantity`; everything else goes through them:

| | |
|---|---|
| `addToStack(tx, characterId, tagId, n, opts)` | create-or-increment. Pins `n` to 1 unless `opts.stackable`, so a caller that forgot to check can't mint a phantom stack. |
| `dropCharacterTag(tx, characterId, tagId, n)` | decrement, deleting the row at 0. `n = null` (the default) drops the whole holding — what an ordinary tag always wants. |
| `restoreCharacterTag(tx, characterId, snapshot)` | undo's inverse. **Increments** on the update branch: `snapshot.quantity` is what the request took away, not what the character should end up holding. |

Add Tag, Remove Tag and Transfer Tag all carry a quantity, clamped
server-side to what the sender actually holds, and record it on
`Request.effect` so Undo stays an exact inverse (`REQUESTS.md` §2). A GM's
Revoke button takes one unit off a stack rather than the whole larder.

**Point-buy never stacks.** `PointBuy.js` is a toggle-set with no quantity
anywhere, so a bought tag lands on `quantity`'s default of 1 and a stackable
tag cannot be point-farmed at creation. Stacks are built in play only.

**`stackable` combines safely with `durationTurns`.** It didn't used to —
the sweep deleted whole rows, stack and all — but `sweepExpiredStacks()`
(`db/index.js`) now sheds a single unit per expiry and rerolls the
remainder's timer, deleting the row only when the last unit goes. So three
of a two-turn tag lose one every two turns.

## 5b. Consuming

`consumable` marks a tag a player can **use up** from their own character
sheet, and `consumesInto` (a list of tag *slugs*) is what it turns into. A
meal is `consumable` with `consumesInto: [ate-meal]`; `ate-meal` carries
`durationTurns: 1` and the Hunger pass consumes it — so the whole chain falls
out of machinery that already existed. Nothing here is meal-specific: the one
rule that *is* about meals (a Fine Meal cheers everyone but a noble) is
expressed as catalog data in `docs/tags.yaml`, not as code.

Five rules carry it:

- **Always exactly one unit.** Consuming from a stack of three meals takes
  one, so there is deliberately no quantity field in this path at all.
- **Slugs, not a relation, specifically so a slug may repeat.** Listing one
  twice is the only way to ask for two of something — and that only
  multiplies for a `stackable` target; a non-stackable repeat collapses to
  one, exactly like §5a's rules elsewhere.
- **A granted tag starts its own clock.** `expiresTurn` is computed as
  `turn.number + defaultDurationTurns` at the moment of the grant — the same
  absolute-turn expression every other writer uses — which is what makes
  chains work (meal -> Ate Meal that the sweep then clears).
- **An already-held non-stackable grant is left completely alone**, expiry
  included: the character's existing one is the live truth, and clobbering it
  would silently extend or cut short something they already had. One
  consequence worth knowing: eating a Lavish Meal while already Happy does
  *not* extend Happy, unlike `setMoodRequest`, which deletes and re-creates the
  tag and so refreshes its clock. Undo depends on `added: 0` meaning "this
  request didn't grant it", so a refresh here would need its own snapshot.
- **A grant may be conditional.** A `consumesInto` entry can be an object
  rather than a bare slug, and is then granted only to a character holding
  *none* of its `unlessTags`:

  ```yaml
  consumesInto:
    - ate-meal
    - slug: happy
      unlessTags: [nobility]
  ```

  `Tag.consumesInto` still stores every target slug in order; the conditions
  live beside it in `Tag.consumesIntoUnless` (`Json`, null for the many tags
  that have none), and `syncTags.js` validates both halves against this file.
  `resolveConsumeGrants()` in `web/lib/consumeGrants.js` applies them, and is
  deliberately pure so the server action and the client "Becomes:" preview
  share it — a preview that promised a noble the Happy they won't get would be
  worse than no preview. Fine Meal is the only conditional entry today:
  it cheers an ordinary person, while Nobility expect one as a matter of
  course.

Consuming is a **Request** (`CONSUME_TAG`), so it lands immediately, carries
a reason, and a GM can Undo it — see `REQUESTS.md` §3. The undo snapshot
records what was *actually* added per slug (`added: 0` for a grant that was
skipped as already-held), because Undo may only take back what this request
really put there.

`grantTagSlugs()` in `web/lib/requestEffects.js` is the single writer, a
fourth sibling to the three stack primitives in §5a.

**This replaces the old `grantsOnExpiry` ("expires into") field**, which did
the same conversion on a timer instead of on demand. It was removed outright:
letting the player choose *when* to unpack a crate is strictly better than
making them wait a turn, and two near-identical "tag becomes other tags"
mechanisms in one catalog is one too many.

## 6. Things that used to be tags and aren't anymore

`Leader` and `Treasurer` were retired as tags in the same rework that
introduced this system (and were finally removed from `docs/roles.yaml`'s
`starting_tags` too, in favor of per-role `leader:`/`treasurer:` booleans) — both are now plain booleans on `Character`
(`isLeader`, `isTreasurer`), assigned dynamically by a GM (Leader) or by a
GM/the faction's own Leader (Treasurer) from `/faction`
(`web/app/(app)/faction/actions.js`), exactly as before — only the storage
mechanism changed, not who can assign what. `Courtier` was deleted outright
(it only ever gated the now-ungated `Manor` tag). `Mortus` and `Hunter`
survived the "Role" category's retirement as ordinary tags (General and
Skills respectively) since both drive real logic elsewhere — Mortus gates
`/lifeweb` nav visibility, Hunter drives a production-tier check in
`bot/src/lib/labor.js`.

## 7. Where the code lives

`db/lib/syncTags.js` (the sync itself), `db/prisma/sync-tags.js` (terminal
entry point, `npm run db:sync-tags`), `docs/tags.yaml` /
`docs/taggroups.yaml` (content), `web/app/api/tags/route.js` (read API
backing `{tag:slug}`/`{tag:id}` references,
`web/app/components/RichText.js`/`TagsProvider.js`), `TagChip.js`
(the hover-tooltip chip that renders group color).

`hunger`, `hungerless` and `ate-meal` are the first tags granted and consumed
by automatic game logic rather than by a player, a GM, or a starting package —
`db/lib/hungerPass.js` is their only writer, and `db/lib/gambitModifier.js`
their only reader. `db/lib/constants.js` holds the slugs so neither file
hardcodes a string.
